# Disease Classification with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to classify diseases based on symptom data. It includes data preprocessing, label encoding, class imbalance handling, and evaluation using various classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Random oversampling to balance classes
- Model training and accuracy comparison

## How to Use
1. Load the `improved_disease_dataset.csv` file.
2. Run `Untitled30.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Review model outputs and accuracy scores.

## Requirements
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
